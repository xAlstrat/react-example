# Pluscoder Product Details

## Problem Solved
Pluscoder is the first coder that doesn't need a human to run any code task in a repository. It addresses common developer needs such as:
- Documenting code
- Writing new code
- Applying coding standards
- Implementing security patches
- Solving technical debt
- And more, across multiple repositories

Key advantages:
- Can run anywhere, not limited to a specific IDE
- Secure operation, never sending your code baseline outside your company

## Target Audience
Pluscoder serves all kinds of developers:
- Junior developers: Acts as a copilot for those starting their coding journey
- Senior developers in big companies: Helps automate complex repository tasks

## Unique Selling Points
1. One-line execution: Fully automated operation with minimal setup
2. Data security: Your code never leaves your company
3. Complex workflows: Based on tasks and objectives to update repositories
4. Custom specialized agents: Solve very specific tasks
5. Beyond coding: Handles documentation, brainstorming, planning, prioritization, etc.

Pluscoder operates as a Command Line Interface (CLI) that:
1. Takes a list of requirements or tasks
2. Utilizes LLM (Large Language Model) agents to apply changes in your repository
3. Can be run on Python & Docker
